        You travel toward Mount Chelmos. The road becomes quieter as you move away from the towns and farms. The air grows colder as the mountain rises ahead of you. Tall pine trees surround the trail and the sound of birds slowly fades until everything feels still.
        
        Small streams run down along the rocks and disappear into narrow cracks. The path is empty and the mountain feels old and private, as if it remembers more than any traveler ever could.
        
        After a long climb, the trees open and a dark river stretches across the base of the mountain. Pale shapes drift above the water with no sense of direction. A small wooden boat slowly moves toward the shore.
        
        A ferryman stands at the back of the boat. His clothes look worn and his face shows no expression. He does not speak, but he seems to know why you are here.
        
        You stand at the riverbank. Charon waits for your decision.
